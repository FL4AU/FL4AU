**Title**: The rise of machine learning and federated learning in space and astronomy\
**Presenter**: Dr Aidan Hotan, CSRIO, Australia\
**Abtract**: Machine learning (ML) has been a key driver of many data-driven applications over the past decades. As such, the rapidly growing space and astronomy take advantage of recent ML advancements to automate the telescope to explore the universe better. The recent rise of federated learning (FL) is a strategy whereby each device trains its model and then shares the parameters with a central server for aggregation. This exploits both ‘decentralized data’ (data not stored in one location) and ‘decentralized computing power’ available in the modern world to utilize data from different devices without compromising user privacy, which aligns with the requirement of regionally dispersed data in space and astronomy. This talk will briefly introduce several ML applications, such as image classification, object detection, and anomaly detection in the space and astronomy context. Moreover, the presentation will cover three FL applications in space and astronomy, including FL in satellite communication networks, FL in satellites and ground station communication, and FL with data security and privacy in space. \



**Title**: Adversarial Attacks and Defenses in Deep Learning: from a Perspective of Cybersecurity\
**Presenter**: A/Prof Tianqing Zhu, University of Technology Sydney\
**Abstract**: The outstanding performance of deep neural networks has promoted deep learning applications in a broad set of domains. However, the potential risks caused by adversarial samples have hindered the large-scale deployment of deep learning. In these scenarios, adversarial perturbations, imperceptible to human eyes, significantly decrease the model’s final performance. Many papers have been published on adversarial attacks and their countermeasures in the realm of deep learning. Most focus on evasion attacks, where the adversarial examples are found at test time, as opposed to poisoning attacks where poisoned data is inserted into the training data. Further, it is difficult to evaluate the real threat of adversarial attacks or the robustness of a deep learning model, as there are no standard evaluation methods. Hence, with this paper, we review the literature to date. Additionally, we attempt to offer the first analysis framework for a systematic understanding of adversarial attacks. The framework is built from the perspective of cybersecurity so as to provide a lifecycle for adversarial attacks and defenses. \



**Title**: Federated learning and healthcare analytics\
**Presenter**: Dr Allison Clarke, Commonwealth Department of Health and Aged Care, Australia\
**Abstract**: In this presentation we are reporting on research we have done on ‘Inferring chronic conditions from administrative health data’ and discussing how this type of work fits into federated learning. Chronic conditions are the leading cause of illness, disability, and death in Australia. Effective prevention and management of chronic conditions is a priority for the Australian Government. Prevention activities can help reduce the volume and severity of disease, provide long-term cost savings, and improved health outcomes. For those living with chronic conditions, effective management enables minimisation of multi-morbidities, complications and associated disabilities, improved quality of life and greater opportunity to contribute to Australia economically through employment. While the Australian Healthcare System collects data on healthcare services and medications through the Medicare Benefits Schedule (MBS) and Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS), this data does not contain diagnostic information on chronic conditions, making it challenging to determine which people may have these conditions. This research offers the opportunity to improve our understanding of healthcare service use and outcomes for people with chronic conditions, supporting the development of targeted and near real-time policy decision making.



**Title**: Federated causal learning and reasoning\
**Presenter**: Dr Mingming Gong, University of Melbourne\
**Abstract**: Causal learning and reasoning aims to learn causal graphs from data and make use of to draw causal conclusions. However, data owners may not be able to share data due to privacy concerns, which poses challenges for causal learning and reasoning. In this talk, I will review recent advances in causal learning and reasoning in federated settings. In addition, I will introduce our recent work on learning causal graphs in the federated setting with heterogeneous data. Finally, I will discuss possible future directions in federated causal learning and reasoning.\


**Title**: Privacy Preservation in Collaborative Learning\
**Presenter**: Dr Guandong Bai, University of Queensland\
**Abstract**: Collaborative learning enables two or more participants, each with their own training dataset, to collaboratively learn a joint model. It is desirable that the collaboration should not cause the disclosure of either the raw datasets of each individual owner or the local model parameters trained on them. Existing approaches based on differential privacy mechanisms or homomorphic encryption may introduce a loss of model accuracy or imply significant computational overhead. In this talk, I will introduce our efforts in privacy preservation in collaborative learning. We address this problem through the lightweight additive secret sharing technique and colony-based gradient descent. We aim to protect local data and local models while ensuring the correctness of training processes.

### To be decided soon

`workshop-template-b` is a Jekyll project to create a simple workshop website, with a [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/)-based theme, designed for hosting on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/).

It works best for about 5 pages of instructions, plus index, all written in Markdown. 
The navigation to the main pages is exposed at top and bottom of each page for easy stepping through the lessons.

### Why?

Rather than making slides for a workshop, why not make a website? 
It's easier to write, access, share, and reuse. 
GitHub and GitHub Pages makes this pretty easy.

It is a better [Open Educational Resource](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_educational_resources) since anyone can make a copy and adapt!

## GitHub Pages 

One amazingly useful GitHub feature is [GitHub Pages](https://guides.github.com/features/pages/).
It provides free static web hosting from any repository.
Gh-pages is intended to host relatively simple sites for your GitHub portfolio, project, or documentation.
Because it is free and a valuable transferable skill, this is a great option for teaching and learning.

Many organizations are using GitHub to collaboratively create and publish public workshop websites. 
For example: 

- [Programming Historian](http://programminghistorian.org/)
- [Software Carpentry](https://software-carpentry.org/), [Data Carpentry](http://www.datacarpentry.org/), [Library Carpentry](https://librarycarpentry.org/)
- this site!

{% capture text %}Note:
There are *soft* limits and guidelines for gh-pages usage: sites should be < 1GB, use < 100GB bandwidth per month, and make < 10 builds per hour.
If your site exceeds these quotas, GitHub will send you a notice asking you to modify the repository.
All content must follow the [community guidelines](https://help.github.com/articles/github-community-guidelines/), e.g. no violence, obscene sex, or illegal stuff.{% endcapture %}
